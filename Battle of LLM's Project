(Verse 1)
Yo, mic check, one two, can the future hear this flow?
From the savannas to the streets, where innovation grows
We the children of the sun, where stories ignite the spark
Ancestral wisdom meets the code, rewriting the dark
Grandparents spun tales by firelight, of futures yet untold
Now we scripting realities, with knowledge to behold
No longer just consumers, but creators on the rise
With every line of code we write, a new horizon flies

(Chorus)
This ain't just science fiction, fam, the future's in our hands
We the architects of tomorrow, building on shifting sands
From Lagos nights to Cairo lights, the rhythm of progress hums
African ingenuity, yo, the AI revolution comes

(Verse 2)
We see the world through vibrant hues, a tapestry untold
Our art reflects the problems, solutions yet unfold
The wisdom of the griot, remixed in binary tongue
Teaching machines to understand where humanity has sprung
Imagine AI that speaks with proverbs, heals with ancient lore
Helping hands of robots built on Ubuntu's open door
No more playing catch-up, the future's a playground here
Where every coder's a magician, making dreams appear

(Chorus)
This ain't just science fiction, fam, the future's in our hands
We the architects of tomorrow, building on shifting sands
From Lagos nights to Cairo lights, the rhythm of progress hums
African ingenuity, yo, the AI revolution comes

(Bridge)
Yo, raise your hand if you believe, the future's lookin' bright
Let the beat guide your fingertips, code the stories in the night
From filmmakers to engineers, artists with a cause
Let's rewrite the narrative, rewrite the AI laws
We got the rhythm in our souls, the wisdom in our eyes
This ain't just a song, it's a movement, a nation's rise!

(Chorus)
This ain't just science fiction, fam, the future's in our hands
We the architects of tomorrow, building on shifting sands
From Lagos nights to Cairo lights, the rhythm of progress hums
African ingenuity, yo, the AI revolution comes

(Outro)
Let your voice be the data, your vision be the code
Together we write the future, on a brand new global road
This is the African rise, the revolution's here to stay
Let's code a brighter future, every single coding day!
